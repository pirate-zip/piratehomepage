        What is this?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The AGNAZIP Project is an open-source, visual based modification for AGNAB's <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">AGNABROWSER</a>. Essentially what it does is it overhauls everything visual in the browser. It brings in built-in custom themes, as well as the option to make, upload, and share your own custom theme using the <a href="./theme-maker" target="_blank">AGNAZIP Theme Maker</a>. It also allows for a different, easier modding method for smaller, less impactful mods. For a full list of features, scroll down a bit or click <a href="#featurelist">this link</a> to jump.

        Why does this project exist?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The whole idea for the project started when I suggested a custom themes feature for AGNABROWSER. As it turned out, AGNAB had an idea similar to it already planned out when I suggested it. However, he also had mod support in mind. And the idea for a themes mod was born. Since then, the idea has evolved into what it is now, with an even wider variety of theme customization, as well as the upcoming simpler modding feature.
